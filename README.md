## RUN DEV SERVER

- npm start

## BUILD

- npm run build
- widget.bundle.js is the only file that you'll need from the build.
- you need to put widget.bundle.js in the public folder of the NextJS repo.

## CONSIDERATIONS

- index.html is just a business page example, to see how the widget would look.
